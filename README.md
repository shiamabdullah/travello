## How To Use

#### Installation

```html
If your project is already in an existing python3 virtualenv first install
django by running $ pip install django And then run the `django-admin.py`
command to start the new project: $ django-admin.py startproject \
--template=https://github.com/nikola-k/django-template/zipball/master \
--extension=py,md \
<project_name>
  ### No virtualenv This assumes that `python3` is linked to valid installation
  of python 3 and that `pip` is installed and `pip3`is valid for installing
  python 3 packages. Installing inside virtualenv is recommended, however you
  can start your project without virtualenv too. If you don't have django
  installed for python 3 then run: $ pip3 install django And then: $ python3 -m
  django startproject \
  --template=https://github.com/nikola-k/django-template/zipball/master \
  --extension=py,md \
  <project_name>
    After that just install the local dependencies, run migrations, and start
    the server.</project_name
  ></project_name
>
```
